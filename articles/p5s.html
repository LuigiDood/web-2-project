    <p>I can't necessarily say I've always been a big fan of spin-off games. They often get stuck as plain, unoriginal, like another low-end game with another IP slapped onto it to make sure it sells. But somehow, Persona 5 Strikers defies all expectations I held for a spin-off game. Hack-and-slash musuo games are something I don't have a lot of experience with, so going in I had concerns on things like the gameplay loop and if it would hold up well as a spin-off sequel to Persona 5, and it absolutely did. I could make an entire separate article on what I find bad about P5's other spin-off, Persona 5 Tactica, but for now the focus should be on what Strikers does well. It really feels like an authentic follow up to P5, with a story that you can tell had effort put into and surprisingly holds up eerily well today. The gameplay can admittedly get repetitive sometimes, but I found generally even while playing at the hardest difficulty that the only parts I found repetitive were early boss fights. And of course, a spin-off can't feel like an authentic sequel without implementing game mechanics of the original, which Strikers does very well, as it feels about as true to the original as the developers could have made it.</p>
    <p>Everything in this game tells you how much attntion to detail was put to make it feel like an authentic spin-off over something made just to milk an IP. Every tiny detail from sound to voice acting and music is made to feel authentic, which is extremely impressive from a game that takes an entirely different ____</p>
