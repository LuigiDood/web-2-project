          <h1>Expedition 33</h1>
<!--500-1000 words-->

	<div class="row">
<p></p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a rare breed of RPGs you'll find that hits the sweet spot in every way you can think of. Story? Top-notch. Characters? Fledged-out and interesting. Combat? Enjoyable and unique. Everything put into this game has a soul of its own that makes you enjoy every moment you play it. This Game of the Year winner has been one of the biggest highlights of the RPG genre of the decade so far. 
<p></p>
Entering a ruined world plagued by death, in the French city of Lumiere, your party of Expedition 33, compiled of of brave adventurers and those experiencing their last year of their life, must make the yearly and perilous journey <div I="" FORGOT="" FIX="" THIS="" IN="" REVISIONS=""></div> to stop the Paintress, who every year erases everyone past a certain age from existence, and end the cycle of death. The game immediately gives a good first impression, both in terms of graphics and story. The bizarre fantasy world that unfolds in front of you, and the way the story ties into it never loses its charm throughout the game.
<p></p> 
So much of the game can be summarized as daunting to learn, but not difficult to master. The combat system is one unlike most RPGs I have experienced, where you have a wide range of options to select from. Basic and ranged attacks, items, and of course the spells, the attacks you will rely on the most. These all tie in with a cast with abilities that make them very distinguishable from each other, and make optimizing a small lineup that caps out at 3 members a difficult choice. Some members could be more valuable than others, but the way you use them and their long list of skills, along with a touch of customization to make the most potent combat roster.
<p></p>
Of course, no RPG is complete through only combat. In between, you explore a world full of small side-quests, collectables, costumes, audio logs, and so much outside of the main storyline. No matter what you are doing, the game is always offering something, and on top of that, whatever it is offering is always enjoyable. Even through the later game, your options continue to expand to where you always have something to do if you decide to take a break from the main story.
<p></p>
In combination with a beautiful and vibrant soundtrack, this game always has something new awaiting you around every corner,
